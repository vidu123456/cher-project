# Assumptions & Design Decisions

I assumed the users are first-time homebuyers who learn best through short lessons and interactive quizzes.

I designed the experience to show one lesson at a time.

True/False and multiple choice questions were used to make the learning interacitve.

I used Tailwind CSS to keep the design responsive and consistent across devices.

I kept the layout clean and centered to help focus users on the content.
